## AyushSync Backend

AyushSync Backend is a Django-powered API service containerized with Docker and backed by PostgreSQL for a smooth, reproducible local development workflow. It runs with an ASGI server (Uvicorn) for rapid reloads, applies database migrations on startup, and uses Compose Watch to sync code changes into the running container for fast iteration.

### Key features
- Django + ASGI (Uvicorn) with auto-reload for development.
- PostgreSQL 16 with a named volume for persistent local data.
- One-command setup using Docker Compose (build and up).
- Simple commands for migrations, creating a superuser, and accessing the admin.
